This repository is the first part of a big project. We will create a clone of Airbnb, create objects and interact with them


# How to start it
git clone https://github.com/Sb0009/holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone.git

---
# How to use
We will see the different commands that we can use in our Interpreter


# Create
# Show
# All
# Update
# Destroy

---

#### Interactive mode<a name="id1-2"></a>
In this **Interactive** mode the console will display a prompt (hbnb), that indicates the user can write and execute a command. You need to run the the file ***./console.py***. and if you would like to exit, you need to type ***quit*** in the prompt.
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$

#### Interactive mode

```
user@ubuntu::~/AirBnB_clone$ ./console.py
(hbn) all
[]
(hbn)
```
Now, we are going to start with the command  ***create***
 For this command you can create different classes in different files like these:

* BaseModel ------- (```Class```)
* City ----------------- (```Inherited class from base models```)
* Place ----------------- (```Inherited class from base models```)
* Amenity ----------------- (```Inherited class from base models```)
* State ----------------- (```Inherited class from base models```)
* Review ----------------- (```Inherited class from base models```)


--- ```Public instance atributes``` ---
  * id
  * created
  * updated


```


```
#### Non-Interactive mode
In this **Non-Interactive** mode the console will display a prompt (hbnb) but need to be run with a command input piped into its execution so that the command is running as soon as the console starts. In this mode no prompt will appear, and no further input will be expected from the user.
```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
